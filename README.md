A collection of runtime types and combinators for use with [io-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts)

# TypeScript compatibility

The stable version is tested against TypeScript 3.2.2, but should run with TypeScript 3.0.1+ too

**Note**. If you are running `< typescript@3.0.1` you have to polyfill `unknown`.

You can use [unknown-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/unknown-ts) as a polyfill.
